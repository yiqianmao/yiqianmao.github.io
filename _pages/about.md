I am Yiqian Mao, an associate professor at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I received my B.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, in 2016, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from [Duke University](https://ece.duke.edu/), in 2020. From 2021 to 2023, I was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the department of electrical engineering and computer science, [University of Michigan](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/). My research interests include computational electromagnetics in both frequency domain and time domain, hybrid methods for objects in multilayer media, domain decomposition method, and applications in optics, microwave devices and geophysical exploration.
